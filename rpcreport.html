		QUESTION

<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Did you implement an rpcgenerate program and does it handle all legal IDL files? If not, which test cases should we try in your submission  directory?</li>
At this point, our generator meets all legal IDL files to the best of our knowledge. One point to note that depending if the client or server is generated first, either the generated proxy or stub file will be deleted by the nature of the Makefile provided. Normal generation through ./rpcgenerate works perfectly.
<li class="a">

</li>

<li class="q">What programming language did you use for your rpcgenerate program?</li>
<li class="a">
Put an X in the space next to your choice:
<ul>
  <li>_____ C++ (using the provided type framework)</li>
  <li>___x__ Python (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
  <li>_____ Ruby (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="q">Briefly explain the protocol you use over TCP to request function calls and return the results.</li>
<li class="a">
Our protocol was fairly simple in the sense that we used a widely used message format, (json) to format our requests and responses. Our main
addition to the json format was the prepending of the size of the object (in bytes) to the object. For example we prepending the size of the entire json
object to the beginning of the message and then prepended the size of subsequent objects with the json itself. Our json format included keys for the method, the number of parameters, the parameters themselves, and whether an object was an array or struct. 
</li>

<li class="q">Did you get help from anyone other than your teammate? If "yes", then briefly explain who helped you and how.</li>
<li class="a">
Besides consulting internet resources such as Stack Overflow and Noah, we did not.
</li>


<li class="q">(optional) Do you have any other comments on this assignment (e.g. was it worthwhile, what did you learn from it, do you have suggestions for improvment if the course is offered again)?</li>
<li class="a">
No futher comments at this point in time, except that we apologize for the state of your generation code. 
</li>
